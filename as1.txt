
Java

The programming language which was introduced in 1972 is known as "C" programming language, and it was developed at BELL labs in the USA.
a)True
b)False
ANS: A
Explanation: Fact

To create an object in Java, the new keyword is used.
a) True
b) False
ANS: A
Explanation: JVM is instructed to allot a block of memory, i.e. an object on the heap segment as soon as it encounters the new keyword.

According to object orientation principles there can be few objects which can be in isolation.
a)True
b)False
ANS: B
Explanation: No object exists in perfect isolation; every object is in constant interaction with one object or the other.

A byte is a storage space available on the microprocessor to store the data.
a) True 
b) False

Ans: b
Explanation: A byte is a unit for data measurnment. Also, microprocessors have cache for temporary storage of data.

A source file is a complete file.
a) True
b) False

Ans: b
Explanation: A source file is written in high level language. Before such a file is handed over to the microprocessor, it needs to be converted into a machine readable format. In addition, necessary binary files are also added to a source file in order to finally get the complete file, which is also known as an executable (.exe)  file.


An interpreter takes input in high-level language and produces the output in machine level language.
a) True
b) False

Ans: a
Explanation:  An interpreter is a software, which converts each high-level program statement into equivalent machine-level code. 

An object “HAS-part” is used to deal with the behaviours.
a) True 
b) False

Ans: B
Explanation:  An object considerably has 2 parts- “HAS-part” and “DOES-part”. “HAS-part” refers to the properties/ states/ attributes of an object whereas behaviours are dealt by the “DOES-part”.


The speed of working of the hard disk is fast when compared to the speed of working of the microprocessor.
a) True 
b) False

Ans: b
Explanation:  A microprocessor is created using semiconductor technology which is way faster than the magnetic technology composed by the hard disk.

The compiler takes input in high-level language and produces the output in machine level language.
a) True
b) False

Ans: a
Explanation:  A compiler is a software, which converts code in high-level language into equivalent machine-level code. 


Java is a platform independent programming language.
a) True
b) False

Ans: a
Explanation:  A java byte code can be executed on any platform (OS) regardless of the platform it has been compiled on.


 _________ is responsible to take an executable file from the secondary memory and to place it on the primary memory.
a) Loader
b) Linker 
c) Both a and b
d) None of the above

Ans: a
Explanation:  An loader is a software, which takes a copy of a file (executable file in this case) present on the hard disk (secondary memory)  and to place it on the RAM (primary memory).


Library files are coded in ___________ .
a) High-level language
b) Machine level language
c) Assembly level language
d) All of the above

Ans: b 
Explanation:  Library files are coded in Machine Level Language. As a result, these codes need not be compiled before the linking loader embeds them to the object file hence generating the executable file.


 Which of the following are the disadvantages of RAM?
a) Volatile
b) Compact
c) Expensive
d) Both a and c

Ans: d
Explanation:  RAM is volatile as all its data is erased as soon as electricity stops flowing through it. Also, since it is made using semiconductor technology, RAM is expensive.

_______ is a file that is generated after compiling the source code.
a) Source file
b) Object file
c) Executable file
d) None of the above

Ans: b
Explanation:  The compiler takes source code as the input and generates object file (MLL) as output.

15. _______ is a file that is generated after linking a set of object files.
a) Source file
b) Object file
c) Executable file
d) None of the above

Ans: c
Explanation:  An object file is an incomplete file. The linking loader adds the necessary library files and other object files before the file is finally complete and the executable(.exe) file is generated.

16.Which file contains a bytecode?
A.Function file.
B.Object file.
C.Class file.
D.None of the above.
Ans:C
Explanation:  It can be observed that a bytecode file has .class extension.

17.JVM takes ______ as an input and produces ___________ as an output.
A.Byte Code,Machine code
B.Machine code,Byte Code
C.Byte Code, Assembly level code
D.None
Ans: A
Explanation:  JVM takes Byte Code as an input and produces Machine code as an output.


Java can be coded on one platform and can be executed on any other platform. Which feature is this depicting?
A.Portability
B.Dynamic
C.Secure
D.None
Ans: A
Explanation:  Portability is a feature which enables a programming language to be compiled on one platform and be executable on multiple platforms.

19. The objects which don’t have any references are known as____________ .
A. Empty object
B. Anonymous object
C. Singleton object
D. None of the above
Ans: B
Explanation:  For efficient utilization of memory on the heap, java runs a garbage collector thread every few milliseconds. This thread collects all such objects which don’t have any references. Such objects go by the name anonymous/ garbage objects.

20. Portability can also be called as?
A.Architecture Neutral
B.Machine Independent
C.Platform Independent
D.All of the above.

Ans:D
Explanation:  Portability can also be called as a language being Architecture Neutral, Machine Independent, Platform Independent or even Write Once Run Anywhere.
